The test have been devided over 3 files, for the three different kinds of tests. The first file contains the tests for constructors and make sure all the different types of constructors for the graph are working propely. Testing has been carried out to include as many cases as possible.
The next catagory of test present in the second file "modifier_tests.cpp" contain tests that make sure that the modifiers are working correctly as well as the accessors. The accessor functions are automatically tested for their functionality because they were used to test the modifiers. This method made sure that most of the cases for both the modifiers and accessors were covered.
The third file "iter_test.cpp" contains test that specifically make sure that the custom iterator that was designed for the graph class. This test file covers many cases that would occur with the use of iterators and tests some modifiers that also implemnt these iterators.
